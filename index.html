            product. cut down on sweets, candies, chocolates, soft drinks, fruit juices, biscuits. sugar should be
            consumed in moderation.


            2-Caffeine:

            Coffee is the major source of caffeine. coffee beans are grown with the use of pesticides and herbicides
            that are toxic in nature. caffeine is also found chocolates, colas and other soft drinks so better to avoid
            them. Some signs of caffeine problems are headache, depression, insomnia, high blood pressure, fatigue, etc.
